# onrecord Contract, stub

The full Contract is the first build act of this repo phase. This
stub records the obligations the setup already knows it owes. Each
obligation becomes executable before any feature code that depends
on it lands.

- OR-1. Nothing is stored as a bare fact. Every claim carries who asserted it, when, the evidence, and the chain it superseded.
- OR-2. Claims are never edited, only superseded, and the supersession chain is part of the record.
- OR-3. Retrieval returns the claim and its receipts together, never the claim alone.
- OR-4. When two live claims conflict, the conflict is the answer, with both receipts attached.

## Round 1. The claim store (OR-5 to OR-12)

Contract preparation only in this pass. The build opens
when this repo's turn in the line's build order arrives,
ahead of wallofwrong, whose confessions are stored here.

- OR-5. A record is an append-only JSON lines file. Each
  line is one claim object: an id, the claim text, who
  asserted it, when it was asserted (an ISO timestamp the
  caller supplies; the store never invents a time), an
  evidence list whose entries name a source and a
  reference, and a supersedes field naming the claim it
  replaces or null. A line that fails this shape is a
  named defect at read time, with its line number.
  Test, tests/test_store.py.
- OR-6. Adding a claim appends exactly one line and
  returns the new claim's id, derived deterministically
  from the claim's own content and its position, so the
  same append against the same record yields the same
  id. The file's earlier bytes are never rewritten.
  Test, tests/test_store.py.
- OR-7. A claim whose supersedes names a claim that does
  not exist, or that has already been superseded, is
  refused by name and nothing is appended. Supersession
  is a chain, never a fork. Test, tests/test_store.py.
- OR-8. The live claim on a subject is the head of its
  chain. Retrieval by id returns the claim and its full
  receipts: the claim itself, its evidence, and the whole
  chain behind it, oldest first. Retrieval of a subject
  returns its live claim the same way. Test,
  tests/test_store.py.
- OR-9. Two live claims conflict when they share a
  subject key and neither supersedes the other. Retrieval
  that meets a conflict returns the conflict as the
  answer, both claims with both receipt chains, and a
  marker that says conflict, never a silent pick.
  A subject key is a field the caller sets on the claim;
  claims without one never conflict. Test,
  tests/test_store.py.
- OR-10. A claim may carry a due date. Nothing in Round 1
  acts on due dates; they are stored and retrieved, and
  wallofwrong's confessions will use them. Storing them
  is this round's whole obligation. Test,
  tests/test_store.py.
- OR-11. The store is a library plus a thin command line:
  add, get, subject, and check. Check reads the whole
  record and names every defect it finds (bad lines,
  broken chains, forks), exiting 1 when any exist. All
  failures are named errors with exit 1, never
  tracebacks. Test, tests/test_store.py.
- OR-12. Every write is atomic in the family's sense for
  appends: the line is written and flushed in one append
  operation, and a crash mid-append is detectable by
  check as a defective final line, never as silent
  corruption of earlier claims. Test, tests/test_store.py.
